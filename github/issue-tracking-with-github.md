# Issue tracking with Github

Github has powerful tools that can link your work to github issues!

Let's reference the issue number in a commit:

When we push the commit to Github, the issue automatically detects the reference
in the commit message.

Using language like "Closes #2" in a commit message will close the referenced
image when the commit is merged into master.
