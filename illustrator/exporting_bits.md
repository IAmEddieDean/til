#Scenario
You have a '+' icon you need to export within Illustrator for your iOS application you're working on. How do you export just that icon?

#Great question!

Steps
Find the asset you want to export. Ideally it isn't within another asset, or another artboard. You'll want it to be sitting around on the 'canvas' (the gray nothing-ness)

Press Shift + 'O' – This will give you the artboard creation tool

then you can either...

3a. Click the asset and an artboard will be created exactly at that assets size. If our + is 20px x 20px it should create an artboard at that size. *

or

3b. Click and drag to create a box around whatever it is you're trying to export. A lot of times this will be necessary for objects within a mask.

e.g. Say I created the '+' with rounded edges by putting it within a circle mask for some reason. If I was to click the asset with the artboard tool, the artboard would become whatever the size of the mask is rather than the contents within it.

Then either go to File > Save for Web, or press [CMD + Option + Shift + S]
This will open a huge dialogue that shows you how your asset will be exported. You can click save, and select a location and be done at this step!

or...

You may run into the following scenarios.

5a. Your asset is being cut off for some reason! Why? Rahhhhh. This relates to the '*' in 3a as well.

It's probably because Illustrator has a really annoying pixel grid. There's a huge pixel grid that's the size of the canvas. Which can be infuriating when you need to export assets, and in almost all scenarios I can imagine, you need the grid to be relative to the object, not to the canvas. So, the quick and dirty—but effective way to deal with this. Is when you create the artboard originally, you'll want to go up to the height and width attributes in the top right, and add a pixel or two. It's annoying, but effective.

5b. You want to export 2 versions. One at 100%, one at 200% size. Well good news! You can do this within the Save for Web dialogue box. You don't have to create a new asset and artboard for the 2x sized asset. So yay!

All you need to do is go into the '100%' size box on the right panel, and change that to 200%. You'll need to click into the height or width attribute for it to actually do it for some reason I don't understand, but that's Illustrator for you. Then it'll update in size, and you can hit save!
